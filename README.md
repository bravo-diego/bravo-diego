## About me 

**`Molecular Biologist / Statistician`**

I'm a molecular biologist who decided to move on to data science field. Troughthout last year I focused on developing my data skills through courses and certifications such as __Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate__ and __Excel Skills for Business__. 

Currently I'm studying a master's degree program in __Computational Statistics__ in _Center for Mathematical Research_ ([CIMAT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cimat/?originalSubdomain=mx)). 

At the same time I'm focused on improving my Data Analytics skills and developing an expertise in Python Programming language and its most useful and popular data science libraries through __Applied Data Science with Python Specialization__. Also I'm trying to improve my Data Visualization skills in __Tableau__ (click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diego.godinez.bravo) to see my vizzes).

Since my main goal is to create an online portfolio to show up my knowledge and try to solve real-world business problems, I'm creating this profile so you can see my learning path and growth as a data profesional.
