## About me üòÑ

**`Data Scientist | MSc Statistical Computing @ CIMAT`**

I'm a Jr. Data Scientist with a strong interdisciplinary background. I started my data analytics path during my undergraduate internships, where I analyzed environmental and biochemical data, managed scientific databases, and supported data-driven research in ecotoxicology and public health. Then I decided to formally start my career path at the MSc in Statistical Computing at the _Mathematics Research Center_ (more info at [*Maestria en Computo Estadistico CIMAT Monterrey*](https://mce.cimat.mx/es)), where I developed expertise in data analysis, statistical learning, machine learning, and big data frameworks. As part of my final semester, I worked as a statistical modeling consultant for the [Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Division](https://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/dimei/) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where I designed and implemented a Bayesian network to analyze the effectiveness of a water disinfection process. 

I'm currently expanding my technical toolkit by pursuing the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate to deepen my understanding of scalable data infrastructure and pipelines. I'm also working on improving my data visualization skills using Tableau (click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diego.godinez.bravo) to see my vizzes).

I‚Äôm actively seeking new opportunities where I can contribute to impactful, data-driven solutions.

## Featured Projects üñ•Ô∏è

- **Categorical Data Analysis: National Survey on Governmental Quality and Impact (ENCIG) 2017**  
  Exploring statistical techniques for handling categorical data, with a focus on Correspondence Analysis (CA) and its extension, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), to visualize and summarize high-dimensional categorical datasets.  
  [View Repository](https://github.com/bravo-diego/MSc-Statistical-Computing/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Data-Science/Capstone-Project)  

- **Machine Learning Models for Bacterial Classification Using Metagenomic Data**  
  Bacterial Classification Using 16S rRNA Short-Reads from Amplicon Sequencing. *k*-mer approach, combined with machine learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques, enables pattern identification and accurate bacterial species classification from metagenomic data.\

- **Exploring Mental Health Data to Identify Depression-Related Factors**  
  Conducted an exhaustive exploratory data analysis on a mental health survey dataset to explore factors influencing depression. Started with a baseline logistic regression model and improved accuracy by switching to more sophisticated models and addressing categorical variables. Incorporating the Sleep Duration variable boosted accuracy, and further improvements are expected by adding Dietary Habits. Time constraints limited deeper exploration, but future optimizations could enhance model performance.\
