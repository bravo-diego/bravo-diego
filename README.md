## About me 

**`Google Certified Data Analyst / Molecular Biologist`**

I'm a molecular biologist who decided to move on to data science field. Troughthout last year I focused on developing my data skills through courses and certifications such as __Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate__ and __Excel Skills for Business__. 

Currently I'm focused on improving my Data Analytics skills and developing an expertise in Python Programming language and its most useful and popular data science libraries, all of this through __Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate__ and __Applied Data Science with Python Specialization__. Also I'm trying to improve my Data Visualization skills in __Tableau__ (click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diego.godinez.bravo) to see my vizzes).

I'm interested in learning about Object-oriented programming and at the same time I'm looking for a master degree program in Statistics, Computer Science or Bioinformatics, hoping to be enrolled in a program by the end of the year. 

Since my main goal is to create an online portfolio to show up my knowledge and try to solve real-world business problems, I'm creating this profile so you can see my learning path and growth as a data profesional.
