## About me 

**`MSc Student Statistical Computing @ CIMAT`**

I‚Äôm a former molecular biologist who transitioned into data science field. Currently, I'm pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Statistical Computing Applied to Data Science at _Mathematics Research Center_ (more info at [*Maestria en Computo Estadistico CIMAT Monterrey*](https://mce.cimat.mx/es)), where I've been developed a deep understanding in data analysis, statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, and big data frameworks. My background in biology allows me to bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to data-driven projects.

At the same time, I'm focused on deepening my understanding of statistical theory, improving my data analytics skills, and developing expertise in Python programming through specializations like _Statistics with Python_ series and Kaggle competitions. I'm also working on improving my data visualization skills using Tableau  (click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diego.godinez.bravo) to see my vizzes).

Since my main goal is to create an online portfolio to show up my knowledge and try to solve real-world business problems, I'm creating this profile so you can see my learning path and growth as a data profesional.

If you‚Äôre transitioning to data analytics like me, follow and let‚Äôs grow togheter! üíê
