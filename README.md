## About me üòÑ

**`MSc Student Statistical Computing @ CIMAT`**

I‚Äôm a former molecular biologist who transitioned into data science field. Currently, I'm pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Statistical Computing Applied to Data Science at _Mathematics Research Center_ (more info at [*Maestria en Computo Estadistico CIMAT Monterrey*](https://mce.cimat.mx/es)), where I've been developed a deep understanding in data analysis, statistical learning methods, machine learning and deep learning models, and big data frameworks. My background in biology allows me to bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to data-driven projects.

At the same time, I'm focused on deepening my understanding of statistical theory, improving my data analytics skills, and developing expertise in Python programming through specializations like _Statistics with Python_ and Kaggle competitions. I'm also working on improving my data visualization skills using Tableau  (click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diego.godinez.bravo) to see my vizzes).

Since my main goal is to create an online portfolio to show up my knowledge and try to solve real-world business problems, I'm creating this profile so you can see my learning path and growth as a data profesional.

If you‚Äôre transitioning to data analytics like me, follow and let‚Äôs grow togheter! üíê

## Featured Projects üñ•Ô∏è

- **Categorical Data Analysis: National Survey on Governmental Quality and Impact (ENCIG) 2017**  
  Exploring statistical techniques for handling categorical data, with a focus on Correspondence Analysis (CA) and its extension, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), to visualize and summarize high-dimensional categorical datasets.  
  [View Repository](https://github.com/bravo-diego/MSc-Statistical-Computing/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Data-Science/Capstone-Project)  

- **Machine Learning Models for Bacterial Classification Using Metagenomic Data**  
  Bacterial Classification Using 16S rRNA Short-Reads from Amplicon Sequencing. *k*-mer approach, combined with machine learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques, enables pattern identification and accurate bacterial species classification from metagenomic data.\

- **Exploring Mental Health Data to Identify Depression-Related Factors**  
  Conducted an exhaustive exploratory data analysis on a mental health survey dataset to explore factors influencing depression. Started with a baseline logistic regression model and improved accuracy by switching to more sophisticated models and addressing categorical variables. Incorporating the Sleep Duration variable boosted accuracy, and further improvements are expected by adding Dietary Habits. Time constraints limited deeper exploration, but future optimizations could enhance model performance.\
